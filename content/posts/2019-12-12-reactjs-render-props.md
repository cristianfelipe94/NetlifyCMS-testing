**React Render props**

https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-render-props-pattern

React Class components have by default an object with some properties, some of these properties can be accessed by using ( this.state.props.$something ). If we set a new property, this new property will overwrite default props.

React by default has a render method for every Component. The reason why I forced another Render it’s because ( State ) was not defined when the render method runs even though I used ComponentWillMount as first render function to pull and set the Data into the ( State ).
