Short is sweet: Reduce the amount of required fields for users to sign up, by having a small amount of words and low amount of fields make the user feels that the registration process is short and easy. If the process is too long and you consider that all fields are important, what you can do is split the process into steps and show the user a progress bar.



Keep it clean: When you want someone to do something you don’t want to create distractions so that the user can’t complete the process. Make the interface clear from distractions to get the user’s attention.



Personalize it: Part important is to create trust in the registration process, users need to get comfortable filling out the form.  Demonstrate the user that:

You will not give out private information.

You will not bombard them with emails.

Sign up will give the user VALUE.

You are a trustworthy and honest person and they want to join the community.



Make it Easy: Create predefined options so that the user does not have to guess. For instance having fields for personal information and drop down menus with predefined options.



Guide your Audience: Be clear in what you need, show the user the way the information is needed, show errors and advise the user on how to solve the errors.



Something special for Mobile: Design thinking in mobile devices, create a separate version of the registration process for mobiles.



Use Helpful Validation:  Let the user know that there are some errors when he was trying to fill the form, be clear giving the instructions to solve the issues, also provide feedback when user has completed successfully the form fields.



Provide “Show password” option:

Sometimes systems ask for password and confirmation password so that the user can complete a process, for instance a user trying to login. What if the user forgets the password that was typed in the field? So to avoid this we can add an action that shows the user’s password.



Provide a matching keyboard: Using the correct input type is a good practice because every submitted data has a specific type. We can have data as email address so to store it we will use input type = email. Also users that access the form with a mobile are going to be able to display a specific keyboard type, if the input type = numbers the keyboard will be numeric.



Clearly explain why you’re asking for sensitive information: Provide reasons why the system needs some personal information, this explanation should not be more than 1000 characters.  



Group related fields together: The principle of Proximity was proposed by the psychologist Gestalt, he states that related elements should be near each other. We can have a “section” called ‘Personal Information’ with ‘Full name’ and ‘Favorite Color’ and also ‘Account information’ as a section with ‘Email’ and ‘Password’.



Us different styles for primary and secondary buttons: Avoid having secondary buttons in your tool but if so, make sure that the primary button has a clear visual distinction between them.



Never blame the user: Write messages in a neutral and positive way because if it sounds too hard the user might get frustrated. Instead of “You’ve entered a wrong phone number.” use “That number is incorrect.”.
